## Technologies Used

The portfolio website is built using the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Sass: A CSS extension language that provides more flexibility and features.
- TypeScript: A typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript.
- HTML: The standard markup language for creating web pages.

These technologies were chosen to create a modern, interactive, and responsive portfolio website with enhanced styling capabilities and type safety.
